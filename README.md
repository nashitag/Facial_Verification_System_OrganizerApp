System Design and Implementation

FEATURES

Multi-factor authentication : Higher security

Our solution comes in three parts, a registration app, facial recognition model and backend app for administrators. Firstly, the registration app records the registrantâ€™s details (an image and ID) by taking a picture of registrant as well as recording down their ID. The image will be uploaded to the Publit.io platform via their API and the URL created will be sent over to firebase.
